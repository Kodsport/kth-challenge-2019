  \begin{block}{Problem}
    Given a parametric polynomial curve in the plane, determine whether it is symmetric around some line.
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Solution}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Observe that curve is symmetric around $x$ axis with $t_0=0$ iff $x(t) = x(-t)$ and $y(t) = -y(-t)$ for all $t$

      $\Leftrightarrow$  $x$ has only even degree terms and $y$ only odd degree terms.

    \item Reduce general case to the above:

      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Rotate curve so that $x$ gets even degree and $y$ gets odd degree

      \item Find $t_0$ such that second highest term in $x(t+t_0)$ vanishes.

      \item Check that shifted polys $\tilde{x}(t) = x(t+t_0)$ and $\tilde{y}(t) = y(t+t_0)$ only have even/odd degree terms (ignore constant term)
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
